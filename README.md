# Anomaly_detectionmodel_based_on_gradient_boosting_and_decision_tree
the code in the notebook is a implemantation of [Anomaly_detectionmodel_based_on_gradient_boosting_and_decision_tree](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40860-022-00184-3)
is this code I just evaluate the model on the dataset that I was trained(iot23) on but the paper evaluate the model on the bot-iot and kdd-iot datasets.
This is Confusion Matrix that for iot23 dataset which is beter then the paper

This is ROC curve for iot23 dataset with result like the paper
